# roadmap (TODO)
- Add L and R markers to the dials in the mixing deck (same styling used in the tracks)
- Add more colours for the tracks 
- Add drag to resize notes in the midi editor 
- add looping functionality
- resize regions (auto resize based on largest note in the track)
- add limiters to the dial spinning (change max and min angles)
- change from infinite mixing deck to only reflect the number of tracks 
- fix volume slider styling in chrome and safari (not firefox)
- make dials and sliders (and mute / solo button states) in the mixing deck match the ones in the tracks. 
- fix to be able to remove bars from a track down to zero instead of being stopped at 1 track left.
