# roadmap (TODO)
- fix when adjacent loop bars are broken up by one non looped bar in the middle breaking adjacency
- add looping backend
- resize regions (auto resize based on first and last note in the track, taking priorities over space)
- fix volume slider styling in chrome and safari (not firefox)
- fix to be able to remove bars from a track down to zero instead of being stopped at 1 track left.
