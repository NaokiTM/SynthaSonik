# roadmap (TODO)
- Add drag to resize notes in the midi editor 
- add looping functionality
- resize regions (auto resize based on largest note in the track)
- add limiters to the dial spinning (change max and min angles)
- change from infinite mixing deck to only reflect the number of tracks 
- fix volume slider styling in chrome and safari (not firefox)
- fix to be able to remove bars from a track down to zero instead of being stopped at 1 track left.
